In order to test the web application:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies in the front-end folder and the back-end folder by running "npm install".
3. I have included the api keys to the database so no need to set it up and there is no dotenv file created by me for the sake of keeping things simple, so it will be good to go.
4. Start the front-end in the development environment by running "npm start" from the front-end folder.
5. Similarily start the server by running "npm start" from the back-end folder.
